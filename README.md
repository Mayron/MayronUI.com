This repository contains the source code for [MayronUI.com](https://mayronui.com/) and is no longer maintained. This website is written using Gatsby.js (a React-based framework). 
I'm working on a newer version of the website written using Next.js (another React-based framework) because I have learned a lot since I made this website and the code no longer reflects my best practices. I also enjoy Next.js more than Gatsby.js because I find the code easier to maintain. I had a lot of problems maintaining this repository so I chose to make it public and deprecate it. Feel free to have a look around!
